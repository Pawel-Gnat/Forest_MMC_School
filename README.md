# Forest_MMC_School

Hello, this is my first site that I tried to create, after 2 months of learning, comissioned by MMC School at the end of the course.<br/>
I spent 20 hours to achieve my current result.<br/> I suspend this project, cause I find it too hard to complete properly and I made too many bugs to repair at my level. 

Stack that I used was: 
- SASS with BEM,
- Vanilla JS,
- VSC with Gulp,
- Also tried to use in my code some grid and flexbox.

Tasks that I failed are:<br/>
- [ ] wrong navbar code (why dont I used ul?)
- [ ] problems with image and p inside aboutus section (see media), different result in chrome and firefox
- [ ] failed to create proper scrollspy
- [ ] problems with logo positioning
- [ ] im not sure if I made too many unnecessary classes

I leave that repo for myself. Im going to grind my skills and come back here to rewrite it again. 


***I WON'T GIVE UP***
